# First Steps Tutorial: Finding the Right LDaCA Tool

**Scope statement:** This tutorial teaches you how to choose the right LDaCA component for your first project.

## Step 1 — Clarify your goal

**Question:** *Am I writing code, or do I want a UI?*

**Answer:**

- If you want a UI, you’re looking for the **frontend** docs.
- If you want a Python library, start with **DocFrame**.
- If you want an API integration, start with the **backend**.

## Step 2 — Follow the right quickstart

**Question:** *Where is each quickstart?*

**Answer:**

- DocFrame quickstart → `docframe/docs/index.md`
- Backend quickstart → `ldaca_web_app/backend/docs/index.md`
- Frontend quickstart → `ldaca_web_app/frontend/docs/index.md`

## Step 3 — Pick a tutorial

**Question:** *Which tutorial should I read first?*

**Answer:**

Choose the tutorial that matches your goal:

- **DocFrame**: first analysis pipeline
- **Backend**: first API call
- **Frontend**: build a tiny UI feature

## Step 4 — Keep the scope clean

**Question:** *Why does each project have its own docs?*

**Answer:** To avoid duplicated or stale instructions. Each component evolves independently, so details belong close to their code.

## Recap

**Question:** *What should I do next?*

**Answer:** Open the project‑level docs for the component you chose and follow its quickstart or tutorial. You can always return here if you get lost.
